[project]
# This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
# package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
# users can install this project, e.g.:
#
# $ pip install sampleproject
#
# And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
#
# There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
# specification here:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
name = "ai-service-template"  # Required

# Versions should comply with PEP 440:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/

# For a discussion on single-sourcing the version, see
# https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/
# version = "0.2.0"  # Required
